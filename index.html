        <h3>Expert in Soft Skills</h3>
        <p> During the course of my journey, I had a wonderful time to work with many people around the globe to get my point across successfully and gained key insights into Presentation, Communication, Decision Making, Conflict Management, Leadership Thinking, Public Speaking, Interpersonal Skills, Time Management and Stress Management. I strongly believe that the marketing phrase "Stress Management" needs to be changed to "Doing with Ease" as you don't want to have Stress in the first place and then somehow manage it.</p>

    <h3>Art of Teaching</h3>
    <p>But my best skill is actually Teaching as i have done with my Company’s Workforce as a Subject Matter Expert. I always wanted to inspire and drill down my experience to younger generations. I understand everyday rat race that student's are going through, their feelings to be heard without Judging them, only left to be nurtured in the right direction with a smile, accepting the way they are and still be able to build trust and gain their confidence to work collaboratively which will in turn speed up their growth without any pressure or anxiety. I pay great deal of attention listening to students and listening deeply, being there for them as a much needed support during demanding times by working on their awareness levels, to make them capable, confident and well rounded personalities to handle both personal and professional life situations with absolute ease.</p>
